h2. Metasploit

This folder contains some patches for the metasploit framework and some tools.

The scripts must be executed from the metasploit root directory (where msfconsole and so on can be found).

h3. msfjsencrypt

This tool uses the javascript encryption that was integrated into metasploit with revision "6784":http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/revisions/6784 (see js_encrypt.patch).

Despite other tools, this one does not include the decryption key into the resulting js code - the key is expected to be part of the URL when the script is executed:

<pre>
http://host/file.html?<key> 
</pre>

h3. js_encrpt.patch

The patch for javascript encryption, already integrated into metasploit.

h3. ie_aurora_jsencrypt.patch

Patch adding the described js encryption to the ie_aurora exploit module, not integrated into metasploit.
